The HotelApp needs to manage various hotel services for guest check-in and check-out. These services include valet parking for vehicles, room cleaning, and handling luggage carts. However, the HotelApp aims to interact with these services through a simplified, single interface provided by the FrontDesk. The FrontDesk class should delegate the client's requests to the appropriate service classes (Valet, HouseKeeping, Cart) while abstracting the service details from the client.

Class Definitions:
HotelService (Interface): Defines the common interface for all hotel services.

Valet: A service class implementing the HotelService interface, responsible for vehicle valet parking and pick-up. It includes the pickUpVehicle(plateNumber) method.

HouseKeeping: A service class implementing the HotelService interface, responsible for room cleaning. It includes the cleanRoom(roomNumber) method.

Cart: A service class implementing the HotelService interface, responsible for handling luggage cart requests. It includes the requestCart(numberOfCarts) method.

FrontDesk: The facade class that coordinates interactions between the client (HotelApp) and the individual hotel services.

HotelApp: The client class that uses the FrontDesk facade to access and utilize hotel services seamlessly.
